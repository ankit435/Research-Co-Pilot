Enhancements for Even Better Results
Fine-Tune the T5 Model:

You can fine-tune the T5 model on a custom summarization dataset to adapt it to your domain (e.g., research papers, technical documents).
Add Metadata:

If the PDF has metadata (e.g., titles, authors), include it with the content for better context during summarization.
Refine Text Splitting:

Use semantic splitting (e.g., by paragraphs, headings) rather than character-based splitting for improved logical coherence.
Pipeline Optimization:

Integrate LangChain's summarization chains with Hugging Face models to create a more streamlined workflow.


Custom Models: Try larger models like t5-base or t5-large for even better summaries, if resources permit.


Advanced Chain:
Combine the summarization chain with question-answering or retrieval-based models for a more interactive summarization tool.
